            Ian and I procrastinated our holiday card shoot again this year(oops), so it‚Äôs very possible that you have received this card after
            Christmas. I swear Halloween was only, like, two weekends ago, and
            then suddenly we are overdue to send out holiday cards. Hope you can
            forgive me!
          </p>
          <p>
            It‚Äôs a little bit crazy just how quickly it feels 2023 has gone by.
            We kicked off 2023 in Chicago, spending New Year‚Äôs at Ian‚Äôs house
            with his family and friends. And here we are again, closing out the
            year in the same place, with the same folks. Full circle!
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôve been feeling very sentimental and introspective as of late (as
            I‚Äôm sure many do this time of year). While building out this site, I
            was flipping through the years‚Äô photos and ending up with way too
            much content. So here‚Äôs a lengthier, written update about what I‚Äôve
            been up to.
          </p>

          <h2>day-to-day</h2>
          <p>
            The biggest change this year: I got LASIK! Back in May I decided
            that my eyes were so bad that I should just laser them. The
            procedure is kinda like being abducted by aliens. The whole surgery
            takes less than 15 minutes; they take you to a very white room and
            poke around your eyeballs a little bit, and you‚Äôre done. Then you
            sit in a dark room for a bit before being sent home. A 6 hour nap
            later and you can see. It‚Äôs not perfect yet (my prescription was
            pretty bad to start, which makes it harder to correct), and my eyes
            are still stabilizing, but these days I don‚Äôt wear glasses at all
            anymore. Wild!
          </p>

          <p>
            We‚Äôve lived in our apartment in Greenpoint for a year and a half,
            and it really feels like home now. We were grilling in the park this
            summer when the weather was good, which kinda feels like something
            you‚Äôd only do if you‚Äôre settled in a place. We have our go-to
            grocery spots, favorite takeout places, best places for a night out.
            I even have a friendly mail-passing, package-collecting relationship
            with the restaurant downstairs! (Great restaurant, by the way. It‚Äôs
            called Pierozek and the pierogi are amazing.)
          </p>
          <p>
            As far as how else I‚Äôm filling my free time, I picked up a bass
            guitar toward the beginning of this year and I‚Äôve been jamming with
            a few friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôm still bouldering regularly, too, although I really haven‚Äôt
            gotten any better. But every year I notice my winter coats get a
            little tighter in the shoulders because climbing has made me so
            strong! Sometimes I also play some tennis, when we can get a court.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aaaand I wanted to mention some of my favorite events I‚Äôve gone to
            this year in no particular order: Vulfpeck concert, League of
            Legends LCS championships (haha), Cornell Ultimate‚Äôs 50 year
            anniversary, the US Open, and the Cornell hockey game at MSG.

          <p>
            I‚Äôve been working at Flex (as a product designer) for about as long
            as I‚Äôve lived in Greenpoint. My one year mark was this past June. I
            am pleasantly surprised at how much I‚Äôve gotten to do and how much
            I‚Äôve grown as a designer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flex as a company has been a bit of a whirlwind ‚Äî a classic,
            fast-moving startup. It‚Äôs a little chaotic, but it keeps me on my
            toes. We had a company offsite in New Orleans in May, and I met a
            lot of my remote coworkers in person for the first time. I love
            working from home, but there is definitely something about getting
            together in person that I miss!
          </p>
          <p>
            My one regret is that I probably should have taken more time off
            this year¬†‚Äî¬†I checked in November and I had only taken 9 days!!
            What!! Next year I‚Äôm making a conscious effort to take more of my
            unlimited PTO. (And I‚Äôm taking a decent chunk of this December off,
            too.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Job-related side note: Ian is looking for a software engineering
            role. Let me know if your company is hiring!!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="partial-width journal-section">
          <h2>travel & friends</h2>
          <p>
            When I did actually take time off, I went on a handful of smaller
            trips (mostly with Ian) around the Northeast to visit family, cherry
            blossoms in DC, to Chicago and Phoenix.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the travel highlight of the year was going on an Alaskan cruise
            with some of my besties from Cornell. Alaska was beautiful. The
            glaciers were incredible; they‚Äôre unfathomably grand and the
            patterns in the ice are mesmerizing. Very glad we brought binoculars
            on a whim¬†‚Äî¬†we would have missed some stunning details of the
            glaciers and wouldn‚Äôt have been able to see the whales or other
            wildlife. Plus I got to spend some quality time with some of my
            favorite people.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a while after college, it felt like almost all of my friends
            were from Cornell. But, when I look around at the people I‚Äôve spent
            time with recently, I‚Äôm finding that they‚Äôre from all parts of my
            life. Phoenix, family friends, college, work, post-college life.
            Very thankful for that!
          </p>

            One of the perks of living in NYC has been that it seems like
            everyone eventually swings through. Sometimes just a weekend visit,
            sometimes more permanently. There‚Äôve been a rotating cast of
            couch-surfing friends this year, a handful of friends who recently
            moved here, and even more who have just come to NY to travel & made
            time for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            But not everyone who lives here stays forever. A few of my friends
            moved out of the city to go to business school this year. Selfishly,
            I am a little bummed that I have a few less friends to hang out
            with. (But I am also very proud of them. ü•π)
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, Ian and I went to two weddings, both for friends from home
            (congrats Brendan & Lily and Bryana & Andrew!!!). I‚Äôm a huge baby
            and I cried at both. In my defense, Ian gave a heartwarming best man
            speech at Brendan‚Äôs wedding; not a dry eye in the room. I don‚Äôt
            really have a good excuse for Bry‚Äôs wedding. I‚Äôm guessing we‚Äôre
            going to be going to a lot more of these, so I will invest in some
            waterproof mascara for the next one.

            It feels like I am physically closer to my extended family than ever
            before. My cousins Tongxin, Alyssa, and Ellen all live in the NYC
            area now. We all live a bit far from each other, but it seems like
            everyone is willing to meet in the middle in the name of good food.
          </p>
          <p>
            My mom, Luya & her family, and a big chunk of my dad‚Äôs family are in
            Massachusetts or upstate NY. It‚Äôs pretty convenient to take a train
            to go up for a few days whenever I‚Äôm craving my mom‚Äôs cooking. Yum!
          </p>
          <p>
            My grandpa (Âß•Áà∑) and my dad are still in Phoenix, so they‚Äôre
            missing out on some of the fun. Every time I go home we take Âß•Áà∑ to
            go eat AYCE Kbbq or a buffet and I‚Äôm impressed at how much he can
            eat. I‚Äôm convinced he‚Äôll live forever because his metabolism is
            amazing even at 87.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the highlights of my April visit home was going to a Suns
            game with my dad. He used to play basketball with his friends at the
            park and watch Steve Nash. So it was really nice to be able to take
            him to a playoffs game. We got some free t-shirts! I told him
            everything I knew about Devin Booker and KD and CP3, which is
            admittedly not much. Suns won! (But lost the series. Boo.)

            That‚Äôs all to say that I had a pretty nice year. Very thankful for
            all my friends, lots of love to all my family. Hope you had a lovely
            holiday season and have a happy new year.
